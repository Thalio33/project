		<p><b>Deer</b> (singular and plural) are the ruminant mammals forming the family <i><b>Cervidae</b></i>.The two main groups are the <i class="taxonomy order">Cervinae</i>, including the muntjac, the fallow deer and the chital,and the <i class="taxonomy order">Capreolinae</i>, including the reindeer (caribou), the Western roe deer, and the Eurasianelk (moose). Female reindeer, and male deer of all species (except the Chinese water deer),grow and shed new antlers each year. In this they differ from permanently horned antelope, which are in the same order, Artiodactyla.</p>
		<p>The musk deer of Asia and water chevrotain (or mouse deer) of tropical African and Asian forestsare not usually regarded as true deer and form their own families: Moschidae and Tragulidae, respectively.</p>
		<p>Deer appear in art from Palaeolithic cave paintings onwards, and they have played a rolein mythology, religion, and literature throughout history, as well as in heraldry. Their economic importance includes the use of their meat as venison, their skins as soft, strong buckskin, and their antlers as handles for knives. Deer hunting has been a popular sport since at least the Middle Ages, and remains an important business today.</p>
